# Why wet-paper-sack?

One time I heard a guy say:
Yeah we hire lots of guys out of boot camps. Some good, some a little rough, and most can't code their way out of a wet paper sack. They have the education but they lack experience and competence. 

I have experience. I have lots of experience. I've been writing code for myself as a hobby since I was in sixth grade, my mother thinks I'm competent, and I'm about to code my way out of a wet paper sack.

Yes. I am way too literally interpreting some random internet guys words of wisdom and actually coding my way out of a wet paper sack in an effort to gain a 1-UP on boot camp graduates.

# What does it do?

wet-paper-sack is an (interactive program | game | thingy | abomination) with two simple goals, to escape the wet-paper-sack and land me a job as a software developer.

# Rules
1. I will try to apply to ten jobs a week and make ten commits a week.
2. Every week I will make a new branch (named with the date included). This way you can clearly see how the project started and progressed.
3. I will use a language I do not know. Learning to use new languages and tools is practical. Hiring someone who already knows 3-5 random proprietary technologies is not.
